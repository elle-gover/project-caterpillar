# Project Caterpillar
**Detroit Labs Apprentice Zeta Group Project #1. By Elle Gover, Leeann Drees, Jordan Jones, & Mitch Socia.**

Joey is a multi-view, interactive iOS app that tracks the growth progress of swallowtail caterpillars through the different stages of their life cycle.

Learn about swallowtail butterflies in the Lifestages section, and record your own caterpillar's progress with the Journal feature.
